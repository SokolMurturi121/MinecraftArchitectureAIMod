# Minecraft CO-creative artificial intelligence Data gathering Mod
The aim of this mod will be to develop a system that gathers data about where people place blocks when creating houses or structures within the game Minecraft. This information will then be stored within an SQL Database. This information will then, hopefully be used to help train a DNN or any other NN to build an agent which will work alongside the player to create structures in the game.

Not a huge ammount of progress towards data gathering moreso maintance and ensuring that the mod is setup correctly with the client and server side settings being the main focus. Along side this I have added a custom creative tab. I hadn't reallized in creative mode in minecraft provides unlimited building blocks. But I could add marker blocks which the agent could look out for such as end building this house block or something.
