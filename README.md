The aim of this mod will be to develop a system that gathers data and stores it within an SQL Database about where people place blocks when creating houses or structures within the game Minecraft. This information will then, hopefully be used to help train a DNN or any other NN to build an agent which will work alongside the player to create structures in the game.
